# Build a Random Quote Machine - FCC
### by Helen Shiu

## Intermediate Front End Development Projects
### Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/ONjoLe/.
### User Stories: 1. I can click a button to show me a new random quote. 2. I can press a button to tweet out a quote.

Fulfill the user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen.
